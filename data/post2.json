    "text": "# Bird\n\nIt was passed from one bird to another,\nthe whole gift of the day.\nThe day went from flute to flute,\nwent dressed in vegetation,\nin flights which opened a tunnel\nthrough the wind would pass\nto where birds were breaking open\nthe dense blue air -\nand there, night came in.\n\nWhen I returned from so many journeys,\nI stayed suspended and green\nbetween sun and geography -\nI saw how wings worked,\nhow perfumes are transmitted\nby feathery telegraph,\nand from above I saw the path,\nthe springs and the roof tiles,\nthe fishermen at their trades,\nthe trousers of the foam;\nI saw it all from my green sky.\nI had no more alphabet\nthan the swallows in their courses,\nthe tiny, shining water\nof the small bird on fire\nwhich dances out of the pollen.\n\nPablo Neruda"
